# Atari-Space-Invaders-DQN-Agent

Reinforcement Learning Coursework submission for my MSc Data Science @ City University, London (2020).

## Overview

Applying Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent and other variants - e.g. Double DQN, Prioritised Replay, Dueling - to learn a successful policy for Space Invaders directly from the game's raw video display and associated rewards (i.e. game score). DQN Agent uses a Convolutional Neural Network to approximate the Q-function and derive the policy. Agent training is carried out using the Space Invaders-v0 environment from OpenAI Gym.

## Repo Contents
 
 * code - contains implementation of DQN agent (and variants) in python. 
 * report - write-up outlining coursework theory and approach, and key results.
